Prompt 1: I personally found these tutorials a little challenging to get through. While I was never completely lost at any point, navigating through all the different browsers and desktops, was a little confusing for me. I think I'm pretty computer and proficient with technology but a lot the websites used in these tutorials were completely foreign to me, so navigating through all them was my biggest challenge. I feel like this definitely made my experience going through these tutorials a lot easier because at least I know how top navigate a computer and wasn't completely lost when it came to uploasding files and things of that nature. 
Prompt 2: I feel like I had a generally easy time with the assignment this week but I definitely see how this could have been extremely confusing for someone trying to navigate a computer for the first time. We had to install and use three different web browsers sp IO think navigating all at the same time definitely would have been a challenge. I think someone who is less experienced with computers should definitely use youtube videos, AI, and also their peers or the professor in order to be able to complete assignments like these. I think this definitely relates to how somebody may have difficulty with installing and running a video game because we have to run video games through different websites and browsers, so I think it's important that we all learn how to navigate foreign browsers.
